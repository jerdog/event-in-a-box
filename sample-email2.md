hi all,

Gluecon is coming up quickly! We've got a great team of people who will be there representing Chef, and I'm excited to see you all there! Please take a few minutes to read through this email and get back to me with any questions ASAP.

Here are the basic details:
- May 20-21 at the Omni Interlocken Hotel in Broomfield, CO.
- We're Copper sponsors, and have a 5x5 booth in the expo hall on Wed/Thurs
- Joshua Timberman (Chef 101: Breaking Down the Jargon) and Charles Johnson (How to Test Convergent CM Systems in Seconds with Test Kitchen & Docker) are both speaking on Wednesday afternoon at 2:15 and 3:45 respectively.
- While you're at the conference, please be _at the conference._ What do I mean? No answering emails on your phone or working on your laptop while at the booth. Engage with the audience. Make conversation. Draw people in. If you need to step away to do some work, that's fine, but don't do it at the booth.

For those of you who haven't been to Gluecon before, it targets developers, so it’s a little different than our typical, primarily ops audience. We haven’t sponsored this conference in a while, but we have a chance to really make a splash this year with two talks, and a booth presence. Ansible will also be there as a copper sponsor, so it will be interesting to see how they participate and what impact they have. We’ll definitely want to be ready for questions about what sets us apart. I’ve attached our current work-in-progress “battle card” around this topic, and would encourage you to take a look at it before you arrive. I'll also have a copy printed out at the booth.

We are sponsoring and supporting Gluecon to:
- Fuel the love of Chef.
 -- At the booth and beyond, we need to excite people about the amazing things you can do with Chef and re/affirm the decision to go with Chef.
- Make it easy to be successful with Chef.
 -- We need people on hand that can answer tough technical and implementation questions from customers and prospects
- Give organizations reasons to buy.
 -- Let's share our roadmap, demo our new tools (DELIVERY!), etc.
 -- Talk to people about what sets us apart from the other tools and companies (community especially).
- Be their favorite company to work with.
 -- Recruiting - we also want to be their favorite company to work for.  Gluecon is a great place to meet potential employees. We’ve got some great openings right now. Let me know if you have any questions about specific openings so we can pass prospective employees along to the right people. I'll have a copy of these jobs printed out at the booth as well.
- Speed matters; be disruptive
 -- How do we make sure we've disrupted the conference in a way that makes everyone think positively about Chef?

Here are a few specifics:
- We have two packed days in Colorado ahead of us. The booth will be open 8am-7:30pm Wednesday, and 8am-3:30pm Thursday. The peak booth staffing times (aka the times I will need you all to be available) are as follows:

Wednesday:
Morning breaks: 8-8:30 am, 10-10:15am
Lunch break: 12-1:30pm
Afternoon break: 3:30-3:45pm
Evening reception: 6:30-8pm
Thursday:
Morning breaks: 8-8:30am, 10:30-11am
Lunch break: 11:50am-1:15pm
Afternoon break: 3-3:15pm

- I’m flying into Denver Tuesday evening, and will be onsite at the convention center early (read: 6:30am) Wednesday morning to set up the booth. I know it’s early, but let’s meet at the booth on Wednesday morning at 7:30am for a quick walk-through of the week.
- We've shipped stickers, t-shirts, resource cards, and various paper collateral to hand out at the booth. The t-shirts will go quickly (we only have 50 total), so let’s be judicious about how we hand them out… making sure that people are aware of or at least interested in Chef.  
- We’ll be scanning badges with an app called Bubbler. Here’s how you get it:

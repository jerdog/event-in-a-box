#Event in a Box
your go-to checklist for sponsoring an event, Chef style.
Having a remote company means you get to work from home (or wherever you choose to call home that day). It also means you have an opportunity to connect with your unique community, and be the face of Chef to those people. You're the person on the ground who knows the local meetups and events, as well as the people who frequent both, and can therefore provide valuable feedback to the rest of the team.

While we often want to have some sort of presence at the events that you come across, we don't always have the time to organize that presence. Here's where you come in! This "Event in a Box" repo will walk you through how you can help organize a Chef presence at local and regional events in your area, as well as what we need from you in exchange.

We can't promise a presence at #alltheshows, but we do want to help you be successful in your area. Just keep in mind that we do have a budget, so we need you to be invested in the event, and to help us decide whether or not it's a good investment for the company. For example, we know that we typically want to be at any DevOpsDays events and regional Linux/Open Source conferences. You know your local area best, so let us know why we should be there and we'll see what we can do.
